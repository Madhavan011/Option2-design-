‚úÖ What You Need to Do:
Create Wireframe Sketches:

At least two views of your site:

Mobile view (e.g., smartphone layout)

Larger screen view (e.g., desktop or tablet layout)

Optional: If your site includes a unique landing page layout, sketch that separately.

Design Tips for Wireframes:

Use only black, white, and grey ‚Äì avoid color, fonts, or fancy styles.

It‚Äôs okay to include actual content labels like ‚ÄúLogo‚Äù, ‚ÄúNavigation‚Äù, ‚ÄúImage‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSign-up Form‚Äù.

Keep the sketches clear and organized.

Upload an Image:

Take a photo or scan of your sketches.

Make sure the image is clear and legible.

Write a Short Description (Write-up):
In your write-up, briefly explain:

What each view represents (e.g., mobile home page, desktop contact page).

Any unique features or layout choices.

If you added a landing page, describe its purpose and design.

If You Created a Video Instead:

Paste the URL to your video in the space provided on your submission form.

‚úçÔ∏è Sample Write-Up (You Can Edit and Use This):
Write-Up for Wireframe Assignment
I have created wireframe sketches for both mobile and desktop views of my website. The site is a personal portfolio that includes a landing page, an "About Me" section, a gallery, and a contact form.

The mobile view is a simplified vertical layout with a hamburger menu and single-column sections for readability.

The desktop view uses a horizontal navigation bar, a three-column layout for the gallery, and visible social media icons.

The landing page sketch shows a hero image with a welcome message and a call-to-action button.

All sketches focus on structure and content placement without using color or styling.

Would you like me to generate sample wireframe sketches for you in image format that you can include in your assignment?

Instructions

This assignment requires that you create an image in which you show (and describe) the sketches you have created for you site. You will pay special attention to demonstrate that you have at least two unique views - one of which should be a mobile view.

Upload an image that shows the design sketches you have created for your site.

Each site should have at least two views (mobile and larger screen).

If you plan on having a landing page (a unique page that has a different layout than the others), make sure to include a sketch of that as well.

Remember, good wireframes should not utilize color, font etc. but it is okay to include content.

Please include a brief write-up.
